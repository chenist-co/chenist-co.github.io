## Webinar Overview

As AI systems become increasingly integrated into critical domains such as healthcare, finance, hiring, and criminal justice, the ethical implications of these technologies cannot be overlooked. Developers play a crucial role in ensuring AI systems are built responsibly from the ground up.

In this comprehensive webinar, Dr. Sarah Wilkins, a renowned AI ethics researcher, will bridge the gap between theoretical ethical principles and practical implementation considerations for developers. Participants will gain concrete strategies for identifying potential ethical issues, mitigating bias, ensuring fairness, and building transparent and accountable AI systems.

## Key Topics

- **Ethical Frameworks for AI Development**: Understanding key principles and their practical applications
- **Bias Identification and Mitigation**: Techniques for detecting and addressing bias in data and models
- **Fairness Metrics and Trade-offs**: Quantifiable approaches to measuring and balancing different notions of fairness
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Methods for building AI systems that respect user privacy
- **Explainability and Interpretability**: Tools and approaches for making AI systems more transparent
- **Testing for Ethical Concerns**: Developing test suites to identify potential ethical issues
- **Documentation Practices**: Creating comprehensive documentation for datasets and models
- **Responsible Deployment**: Strategies for monitoring systems and addressing issues in production

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What programming languages or frameworks will be covered?
The webinar will include examples in Python using common ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, but the principles and approaches discussed are applicable across languages and frameworks.

### Is this webinar suitable for beginners in AI/ML?
A basic understanding of machine learning concepts is recommended, but deep technical expertise is not required. The focus is on practical approaches that can be applied at various levels of technical proficiency.

### Will there be coding demonstrations?
Yes, the webinar includes practical code examples demonstrating implementation of fairness metrics, bias testing, and explainability tools.

### How does this differ from philosophical discussions about AI ethics?
While we'll cover key ethical frameworks, this webinar emphasizes practical implementation rather than theoretical discussions. You'll leave with concrete techniques and tools you can apply immediately in your work.
