# Session Overview

This 2-hour microlearning session introduces QubesOS, a security-oriented operating system that uses virtualization to provide strong isolation between different activities and security domains. Unlike conventional operating systems where all applications run in a single environment, QubesOS compartmentalizes your digital life into separate virtual machines called "qubes," minimizing the impact of potential security breaches. In this session, you'll learn the fundamentals of QubesOS, its security model, and how to leverage its compartmentalization features for enhanced security.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand QubesOS's security philosophy and architecture
- Navigate the QubesOS desktop environment
- Create and manage virtual machines (qubes) for different purposes
- Implement security domains and compartmentalization strategies
- Transfer files securely between isolated environments
- Configure networking in QubesOS
- Develop secure workflows for everyday computing

# Session Curriculum

## Part 1: Understanding QubesOS (30 minutes)

- Introduction to QubesOS and its security model
- The concept of security by compartmentalization
- QubesOS architecture and components
- Hardware requirements and compatibility
- Installation overview (demonstration only)
- First steps after installation
- Navigating the QubesOS desktop environment

## Part 2: Working with Qubes (40 minutes)

- Creating and managing qubes (virtual machines)
- Understanding templates and their purpose
- Security domains and color coding
- Managing applications within qubes
- File management and secure file transfers
- Networking in QubesOS (NetVMs, ProxyVMs)
- Configuring disposable qubes for high-risk activities

## Part 3: Practical Security Workflows (40 minutes)

- Setting up a productivity workflow with multiple security domains
- Secure browsing strategies (multiple browser VMs)
- Managing passwords and sensitive data
- Email security with compartmentalization
- Handling untrusted files and documents
- Setting up development environments
- Balancing security and convenience

## Part 4: Advanced Topics and Resources (10 minutes)

- Common challenges and troubleshooting
- Performance considerations
- Backup strategies for QubesOS
- Keeping your system updated
- Community resources and documentation
- Continued learning path recommendations

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this microlearning session, you will be able to:

- Understand the QubesOS security model and architecture
- Navigate the QubesOS desktop environment confidently
- Create and manage qubes for different security domains
- Implement secure workflows for everyday tasks
- Transfer files securely between isolated environments
- Configure basic networking in QubesOS
- Know where to find help and resources for continued learning

# Teaching Methods

This session combines:

- Live demonstrations
- Virtual machine demonstrations
- Security concept explanations
- Real-world use cases
- Practical workflow examples

# Target Audience

This microlearning session is ideal for:

- Security-conscious individuals and professionals
- Privacy advocates
- Journalists and researchers handling sensitive information
- IT professionals interested in compartmentalized security
- Anyone concerned about malware and targeted attacks

# Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of operating system concepts
- Familiarity with virtualization concepts is helpful but not required
- Comfort with Linux-based systems is advantageous
- Due to hardware requirements, this session will focus on demonstrations rather than hands-on exercises

# Materials

All participants will receive:
