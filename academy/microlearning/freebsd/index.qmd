# Session Overview

This 2-hour microlearning session introduces FreeBSD, a powerful, stable, and secure Unix-like operating system with a long history of reliability in server environments. Unlike Linux distributions, FreeBSD is developed as a complete operating system with a coherent design philosophy. In this session, you'll learn the fundamentals of FreeBSD, its unique features, and how to perform essential system administration tasks in a FreeBSD environment.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand FreeBSD's history, design philosophy, and architecture
- Navigate the FreeBSD file system and shell environment
- Install and manage software with the ports system and binary packages
- Configure basic system settings and services
- Manage users, permissions, and security features
- Understand FreeBSD's networking capabilities
- Perform basic troubleshooting and system maintenance
