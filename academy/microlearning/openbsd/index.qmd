# Session Overview

This 2-hour microlearning session introduces OpenBSD, a Unix-like operating system renowned for its uncompromising focus on security, code correctness, and comprehensive documentation. Unlike many other operating systems that add security features after the fact, OpenBSD is built from the ground up with security as a primary design goal. In this session, you'll learn the fundamentals of OpenBSD, its security features, and how to leverage its strengths for secure computing environments.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand OpenBSD's security philosophy and design principles
- Navigate the OpenBSD environment and command line
- Install and configure a basic OpenBSD system
- Implement key security features and best practices
- Manage software installation and updates
- Configure network services securely
- Understand OpenBSD's security technologies (PF firewall, pledge, unveil, etc.)

# Session Curriculum

## Part 1: Introduction to OpenBSD (30 minutes)

- OpenBSD history and philosophy
- The "secure by default" approach
- OpenBSD project organization and release cycle
- Key security innovations from OpenBSD (OpenSSH, PF, etc.)
- Installation overview (demonstration in virtual machine)
- First steps after installation
- Navigating the OpenBSD file system and documentation

## Part 2: Essential System Administration (40 minutes)

- User management and privileges
- Software management with packages and ports
- System configuration basics
- Updating and patching OpenBSD
- Filesystem security features
- Basic system hardening steps
- Running services securely
- Monitoring and logging

## Part 3: OpenBSD Security Features (40 minutes)

- PF (Packet Filter) firewall basics
- Memory protection technologies
- W^X (Write XOR Execute) enforcement
- Privilege separation
- Pledge and unveil mechanisms
- Address space randomization
- Secure defaults in configuration
- Common security use cases for OpenBSD

## Part 4: Applications and Resources (10 minutes)

- OpenBSD as a firewall/router
- OpenBSD for secure servers
- Desktop usage considerations
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Community resources and documentation
- Continued learning path recommendations

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this microlearning session, you will be able to:

- Understand OpenBSD's security-focused design philosophy
- Install and perform basic configuration of an OpenBSD system
- Navigate the OpenBSD environment confidently
- Implement essential security practices specific to OpenBSD
- Configure basic network security with PF
- Manage software installation and updates
- Know where to find help and resources for continued learning

# Teaching Methods

This session combines:
