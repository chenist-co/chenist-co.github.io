## Event Overview

The SpaceApps Junior Challenge 2025 is a special edition of the NASA Space Apps Challenge designed specifically for participants aged 13-18. This three-day event gives young space enthusiasts the opportunity to solve real-world space challenges using NASA's open data in a supportive, educational environment. The event is designed to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and innovators while making space exploration accessible to youth.

## Challenge Themes

The junior hackathon features simplified challenges across several themes tailored for young participants:

### 1. Earth & Space Science
Explore climate data, natural disasters, or observe stars and planets using NASA's resources. Create projects that help us understand our planet and universe better.

### 2. Space Technology
Create applications, games, or visualizations that help explain complex space concepts to other students. Design interactive tools that make space more accessible.

### 3. Space Exploration
Design ideas for future missions, spacecraft, or habitats for astronauts. Think about how humans might live and work in space in the future.

### 4. Creative Arts & Space
Develop creative projects that combine art, storytelling, and space science to communicate space concepts to the public. Make space exciting for everyone!
