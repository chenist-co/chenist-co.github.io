## Event Overview

The SpaceApps Challenge 2025 is the local edition of NASA's International Space Apps Challenge, a global hackathon that brings together coders, scientists, designers, storytellers, makers, technologists, and innovators to address real-world problems using NASA's open data. This two-day event focuses on developing innovative solutions for space exploration, satellite technology, and Earth observation.

## Challenge Themes

The specific challenges for the 2025 Space Apps Challenge will be announced closer to the event date. These challenges are created by NASA experts and typically cover various aspects of space and Earth science.

For reference, past Space Apps Challenges have included themes such as:

### Earth and Space Science
Analyzing climate data, monitoring natural disasters, tracking biodiversity, or studying celestial phenomena.

### Technology Development
Creating software tools, visualization platforms, or hardware prototypes that address NASA's technological needs.

### Human Health and Habitation
Designing solutions for sustainable living in space, resource management, waste recycling, or psychological well-being.

### Space Exploration
Developing concepts for planetary exploration, spacecraft design, navigation systems, or astronomical research.

You can explore examples of previous challenges from the [2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/) to get an idea of what to expect.
