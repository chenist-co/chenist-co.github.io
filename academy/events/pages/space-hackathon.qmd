## Schedule

### Hackathon Day 1 (October 5)

**Mandatory Hacker Orientation**  
Everyone participating in the hackathon will check in, grab dinner, set up all required software accounts, learn about the challenges, hear from our sponsors and mentors about the support available during the weekend, form teams, and get ready for a weekend of hacking.

**Morning (Starting at 09:00)**  
Everyone will return to the hackathon space for breakfast and our hackathon kickoff, and then get hacking!

Lunch and dinner will also be served.

Organizers and volunteers will be on hand to assist with any questions and help with team placement. Technology and science mentors will also be available in person and virtually to float between teams and answer any questions.

### Hackathon Day 2 (October 6)

We have breakfast and wrap up our projects. Project submission is at noon, followed by lunch. Team demos will start shortly after lunch, will be globally live-streamed, and is open for friends and family to attend (we will send out a separate form for adding people to the guest list for demos).

Around 5pm we will conclude the demos, select sponsors will present their specially branded awards, and our judges will announce the hackathon winners!

**Note:** Participants under the age of 18 require adult supervision for the entirety of the hackathon.
