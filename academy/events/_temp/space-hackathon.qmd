## Event Overview

The Space Hackathon is a three-day event focusing on developing innovative solutions for space exploration, satellite technology, and Earth observation. Participants will collaborate with industry experts and like-minded innovators to address real challenges provided by space agencies and aerospace companies.

## Challenge Tracks

The hackathon offers four parallel tracks, each addressing different aspects of space technology and exploration:

### 1. Earth Observation & Climate Monitoring
Develop applications that leverage satellite data to monitor climate change, natural disasters, or environmental conservation efforts.

### 2. Space Habitat & Life Support
Design systems for sustainable living in space, including resource management, waste recycling, or psychological well-being for astronauts.

### 3. Satellite Communications & IoT
Create solutions that improve satellite communication systems or leverage satellite networks for Internet of Things applications.

### 4. Space Resources & Manufacturing
Propose methods for in-space manufacturing, asteroid mining, or utilizing space resources for sustainable exploration.
