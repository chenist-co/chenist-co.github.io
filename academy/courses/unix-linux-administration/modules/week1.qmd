# Unix/Linux Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the history and philosophy of Unix and Linux
- Differentiate between major Linux distributions
- Navigate the Linux file system hierarchy

## The Unix/Linux Heritage

### Unix Origins and Philosophy

Unix was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. It embodied several key principles that continue to influence operating system design today:

- **Write programs that do one thing and do it well**
- **Write programs to work together**
- **Write programs to handle text streams**

These principles led to the creation of a modular system where small, focused tools could be combined in powerful ways.

### From Unix to Linux

Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds as a free and open-source alternative to Unix. Some key milestones:

- 1983: Richard Stallman announces the GNU Project to create a free Unix-like OS
- 1991: Linus Torvalds releases the Linux kernel
- 1992-1993: Early Linux distributions combine the kernel with GNU tools
- 1994-1995: Commercial Linux distributions begin to appear
- 2000s: Linux gains enterprise adoption
- 2010s: Linux dominates cloud computing and container technologies

### Unix/Linux Today

Today, Unix and Linux systems power:

- Most of the world's web servers
- The majority of cloud infrastructure
- Android devices (Linux kernel)
- Supercomputers and research systems
- Embedded devices and IoT
- Financial systems and critical infrastructure

## Major Linux Distributions

### Distribution Families

Linux distributions ("distros") can be grouped into several major families:

#### Debian-based
- **Debian**: Community-developed, highly stable
- **Ubuntu**: User-friendly, popular for desktops and servers
- **Linux Mint**: Designed for ease of use
- **Kali Linux**: Security and penetration testing

#### Red Hat-based
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**: Commercial, enterprise-focused
- **CentOS/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux**: Free RHEL-compatible distributions
- **Fedora**: Cutting-edge features, sponsored by Red Hat

#### SUSE-based
- **SUSE Linux Enterprise**: Commercial enterprise distribution
- **openSUSE**: Community version with Leap (stable) and Tumbleweed (rolling) variants

#### Arch-based
- **Arch Linux**: Rolling release, minimalist philosophy
- **Manjaro**: User-friendly version of Arch
- **EndeavourOS**: Arch-based with simplified installation

#### Independent
- **Gentoo**: Source-based, highly customizable
- **Slackware**: One of the oldest distributions, minimalist
- **Alpine**: Security-focused, lightweight

### Choosing a Distribution

Factors to consider when selecting a distribution:

- **Stability vs. cutting-edge features**
- **Release cycle** (fixed vs. rolling releases)
- **Package management system**
- **Community and commercial support**
- **Default desktop environment**
- **Specialized purpose** (server, desktop, security, etc.)

## System Architecture Overview

### Linux Kernel

The kernel is the core of the operating system that:

- Manages hardware resources
- Provides process scheduling
- Implements memory management
- Handles file systems
- Provides device drivers
- Offers security and access control

### User Space Components

- **Shell**: Command interpreter (bash, zsh, etc.)
- **Core utilities**: Basic commands and tools
- **System services**: Background processes providing functionality
- **Package management**: Installing and updating software
- **Desktop environment** (if applicable): GUI and associated applications

### Boot Process

1. **BIOS/UEFI**: Initial hardware initialization
2. **Bootloader** (GRUB, systemd-boot): Loads the kernel
3. **Kernel initialization**: Hardware detection and setup
4. **Init system** (systemd, SysV init): Starts system services
5. **Login manager** or **shell prompt**: User interaction begins

## File System Hierarchy

### The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

Linux follows a standardized directory structure:

- **/bin**: Essential command binaries
- **/boot**: Boot loader files and kernel
- **/dev**: Device files
- **/etc**: System configuration files
- **/home**: User home directories
- **/lib**: Essential shared libraries
- **/media**: Mount points for removable media
- **/mnt**: Temporary mount points
- **/opt**: Optional application software
- **/proc**: Virtual filesystem for process information
- **/root**: Home directory for the root user
- **/run**: Runtime variable data
- **/sbin**: System binaries
- **/srv**: Data for services provided by the system
- **/sys**: Virtual filesystem for system information
- **/tmp**: Temporary files
- **/usr**: Secondary hierarchy (user programs, documentation)
- **/var**: Variable data (logs, spool files, caches)

### File Types in Linux

- **Regular files**: Normal data files
- **Directories**: Containers for other files
- **Symbolic links**: Pointers to other files
- **Device files**: Hardware device interfaces
- **Named pipes**: FIFO (first-in, first-out) for inter-process communication
- **Sockets**: Inter-process communication endpoints

## Essential Command-Line Tools

### Shell Basics

- **Terminal emulators**: Programs that provide terminal functionality
- **Shell prompt**: Where you type commands
- **Command structure**: `command [options] [arguments]`
- **Command history**: Access previous commands with up/down arrows
- **Tab completion**: Press Tab to autocomplete commands and paths

### File Navigation

```bash
# Print working directory
pwd

# List files and directories
ls
ls -l    # Long format with details
ls -a    # Show hidden files
ls -lh   # Human-readable file sizes

# Change directory
cd /path/to/directory
cd ~     # Go to home directory
cd ..    # Go up one level
cd -     # Go to previous directory
```

### File Operations

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir directory_name
mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild   # Create parent directories as needed

# Create empty files
touch filename

# Copy files and directories
cp source destination
cp -r source_dir destination_dir   # Recursive copy for directories

# Move/rename files and directories
mv source destination

# Remove files and directories
rm filename
rm -r directory   # Recursive deletion
rm -i filename    # Interactive mode (asks for confirmation)
rm -f filename    # Force deletion without confirmation

# Be very careful with rm, especially rm -rf!
```

### File Viewing

```bash
# View file contents
cat filename       # Display entire file
less filename      # Paginated viewing
head filename      # First 10 lines
head -n 20 filename  # First 20 lines
tail filename      # Last 10 lines
tail -f filename   # Follow file updates in real-time

# File information
file filename      # Determine file type
stat filename      # Detailed file information
```

### Text Processing

```bash
# Search within files
grep pattern filename
grep -i pattern filename     # Case-insensitive
grep -r pattern directory    # Recursive search

# Stream editing
sed 's/old/new/g' filename   # Replace text

# Text manipulation
cut -d ',' -f 1,3 filename   # Extract columns from CSV
sort filename                # Sort lines
uniq filename                # Remove duplicate lines
wc filename                  # Count lines, words, characters
```

### System Information

```bash
# User information
whoami         # Current username
id             # User and group IDs
who            # Who is logged in
w              # Who is logged in and what they're doing

# System information
uname -a       # Kernel and system information
hostname       # System hostname
uptime         # How long the system has been running
date           # Current date and time

# Resource usage
free -h        # Memory usage
df -h          # Disk usage
du -sh directory  # Directory size
top            # Process information (interactive)
ps aux         # Process listing
```

## Getting Help and Documentation

### Manual Pages

The `man` command provides detailed documentation for most commands:

```bash
man command_name
man 5 passwd     # Section 5 (file formats) entry for passwd
man -k keyword   # Search manual pages for keyword
```

Navigation in man pages:
- Space/Page Down: Next page
- b/Page Up: Previous page
- /pattern: Search forward
- n: Next search match
