# Cloud Migration Handbook

## Introduction

This handbook provides a comprehensive approach to migrating applications and infrastructure to the cloud. It covers the entire migration journey from initial assessment through planning, execution, and optimization.

## Migration Strategy

### Migration Approaches

There are several approaches to cloud migration, often referred to as the "6 Rs":

1. **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**: Move applications without modification
2. **Replatform (Lift and Reshape)**: Make minor modifications to take advantage of cloud capabilities
3. **Refactor/Re-architect**: Significantly modify applications to optimize for cloud
4. **Repurchase (Drop and Shop)**: Replace with cloud-native alternatives
5. **Retire**: Decommission unnecessary applications
6. **Retain**: Keep certain applications on-premises

Each approach has different benefits, challenges, and resource requirements. The right approach depends on application characteristics, business requirements, and organizational constraints.
