## Cloud Security

### Cloud Security Framework

Develop a cloud security framework addressing:

1. **Shared Responsibility**: Understand provider versus customer responsibilities
2. **Identity and Access**: Secure cloud IAM implementation
3. **Data Protection**: Encryption and data security controls
4. **Network Security**: Virtual network security and connectivity
5. **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements in the cloud
6. **Security Monitoring**: Visibility into cloud environments
