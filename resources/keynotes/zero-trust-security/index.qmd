# Introduction

## The End of the Perimeter {.center}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Traditional Security Model

* Trusted internal network
* Untrusted external network
* Focus on perimeter defense
* "Castle and moat" approach
* Once inside, minimal controls
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Current Reality

* Cloud adoption
* Remote workforce
* Mobile devices
* Third-party integrations
* Complex supply chains
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
* Emphasize how dramatically the landscape has changed
* Traditional security models assumed clear boundaries
* Today's environment is complex and distributed
* The concept of "inside" vs "outside" is no longer relevant
:::

## The Fatal Flaw {.smaller}

> "The problem with traditional security is that once an attacker gets past the perimeter, they're often free to move laterally within the network."

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Attack Chain

1. Initial compromise
2. **Privilege escalation**
3. **Lateral movement**
4. **Data exfiltration**
5. Persistence

**Bold steps enabled by perimeter-only security**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Breach Statistics

* 280 days: Average time to identify and contain a breach
* 75%: Breaches involving lateral movement
* $4.24M: Average cost of a data breach
* 80%: Breaches that involve privileged credentials

# Zero Trust Fundamentals

## What is Zero Trust? {.smaller}

> "Never trust, always verify."

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Core Principles

* **Never trust, always verify**: No implicit trust based on network location
* **Least privilege access**: Minimal access required to perform job
* **Assume breach**: Design as if the environment is already compromised
* **Verify explicitly**: Authentication and authorization based on all available data points
* **Identity-centric**: Identity as the new security perimeter
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Key Components

* Strong identity verification
* Device health validation
* Micro-segmentation
* Strict access controls
* Continuous monitoring
* Encryption everywhere
* Policy-based automation
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
* Zero Trust is a security concept, not a specific technology
* It fundamentally changes our approach to security
* First proposed by John Kindervag at Forrester in 2010
* Popularized by Google's BeyondCorp implementation
* Now adopted by major organizations and recommended by NIST, NSA, etc.
:::
