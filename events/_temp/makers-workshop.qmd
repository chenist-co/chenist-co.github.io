## Event Overview

The Makers Workshop is a full-day, hands-on event for hardware enthusiasts, bringing together makers, DIY experts, and hardware hackers to build projects and share knowledge. Participants will have access to cutting-edge equipment, expert guidance, and a collaborative environment to turn ideas into working prototypes.

## Workshop Tracks

Attendees can choose from multiple hands-on tracks based on their interests and experience levels:

### 1. Microcontroller Mastery
Learn to program and integrate microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP32 for IoT projects. Create smart devices that sense, connect, and respond to their environment.

### 2. 3D Printing & Modeling
Master the fundamentals of 3D design and printing. Create custom parts and learn optimization techniques for functional prints.

### 3. Electronics Fundamentals
Dive into circuits, components, and soldering. Build your own electronic gadgets from basic components to functional devices.

### 4. Advanced Robotics
Design and construct simple robotic systems. Explore mechanics, control systems, and autonomous behavior.

### 5. Wearable Technology
Combine electronics with textiles and fashion. Create interactive clothing and accessories with embedded technology.
